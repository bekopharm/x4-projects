    Why we try our best to get the socket into the savegame folder:

    It appears that any io or os function (like os.execute or os.remove)
    are unavailable for extensions so we can not simply unlink our socket
    when we have to. So to make this clean we'd have to write and compile
    our own unlink lua lib but since we're going with a vanilla socket lib
    and don't want to meddle with it we make use of a tiny loophole where
    we _can_ remove files by abusing the imported C.DeleteSavegame function.
    
    This function can indeed delete files _in_ the savegame folder. The catch
    is: has to be all lowercase, must end with .xml or .xml.gz, and
    MUST BE in the savegame folder. This is the reason we raise our socket
    right there.

    However I found no way to obstain the full path to saves from any Lua
    function so we have to ask the user for this (done in options menu for
    Named Pipes API)

Important: We can|want not really mimic the NamedPipe feature of X4 Python Pipe Server.
From my understanding it works by reading the "magic" file `pipe_external.txt` of each
module reported by X4 on connect and simply executes it's content. This kinda results in
additional pipes (or not) depending on source in each extension. This links all _very hard_
not only to Python but also to Windows only and this is IMHO a very bad approach for a socket
that should be by design agnostic of the language, tool, framework or even OS that connects to
it. So what we do is kinda open a socket ourself and allowing anyone interested to connect.

This has some drawbacks. For example we multiply the send data on each connection and it's not
said that external apps will be able to deal with data that was not supposed for them in the
first place (error handling).

On reading we kinda will have to build a local buffer that is emptied with each subsequent read
so we don't loose data - or we simply ignore the slight possibility of two clients talking to
the server socket at the same moment. It MAY happen.

Alternatively we may simply spawn multiple pipes. This is theoretically also fine as long as
we remember which `pipe_name` was used already so each app gets their very own socket file
to use. This is probably the best approach in the long run. At least the one app "X4-External-App"
that I know of has a handy .env file where the PIPE variable can be set by it's user. It also checks
the received format and ignores data not suited for it.

At the moment we raise only one pipe server no matter how often this is requested.

We may even do both.

    â€¦and also do UDP while we're on it.
